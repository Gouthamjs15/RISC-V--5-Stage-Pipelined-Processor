# RISC-V--5-Stage-Pipelined-Processor
This repository contains my academic project implementing a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V RV32I processor. The design integrates a fault-tolerant ALU, used as a core to reduce computation errorsâ€”making it suitable for edge AI and aerospace applications where reliability is critical.
